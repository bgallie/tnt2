# NAME
tnt2 - a program the encrypts/decrypts files using an infinite (with respect to the plaintext) key.

# Usage:
  **tnt2** [command]

## Available Commands:
      completion  generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
      decrypt     Decrypt a TNT2 encoded file.  
      encrypt     Encrypt plaintext using TNT2  
      help        Help about any command

## Flags:
          --config string         config file (default is $HOME/.tnt2.yaml)\n      
      -h, --help                  help for tnt2
      -i, --inputFile string      Name of the plaintext file to encrypt/decrypt. (default "-")

# DESCRIPTION
**tnt2** is an encryption/description system that uses an infinite (with
respect to the plaintext) key to encode the data.  The psuedo-random generator
used by **tnt2** can encode approximately 1.680088572×10³⁹ bytes before the
generated key will repeat itself.

# COMMANDS
## encrypt 

tnt2 encrypt [flags]

Encrypt plaintext using the TNT2 Infinite (with respect to the plaintext) Key Encryption System.
### Usage:
  tnt2 encrypt [flags]

### Flags:
      -c, --compress       compress input file using flate  
      -n, --count string   initial block count (default "-1")

  > The count can be given as a fraction of the maximum number of blocks that can be generated by the encryption engine.  Using "SecretKey" as the key and "1/2" as the block count, there are 5.250276786×10³⁷) 32 byte blocks that can be generated, resulting in a starting block count of 2.625138393×10³⁷.

      -h, --help           help for encode  
      -a, --useASCII85     use ASCII85 encoding  
      -p, --usePem         use PEM encoding.

### Global Flags:
          --config string        config file (default is $HOME/.tnt2.yaml)
      -i, --inputFile string     Name of the plaintext file to encrypt/decrypt. (default "-")
      -o, --outputFile string    Name of the file containing the encrypted/decrypted plaintext.
      -f, --proformafile string  the file name containing the proforma machine to use.

## decrypt
Decrypt a file encoded by the TNT2 Infinite (with respect to the plaintext) Key Encryption System.
### Usage:
  tnt2 decrypt [flags]

### Flags:

      -h, --help   help for decrypt

### Global Flags:
          --config string         config file (default is $HOME/.tnt2.yaml)
      -i, --inputFile string      Name of the plaintext file to encrypt/decrypt. (default "-")
      -o, --outputFile string     Name of the file containing the encrypted/decrypted plaintext.
      -f, --proformafile string   the file name containing the proforma machine to use.

## version
Display version and detailed build information for tnt2.
### Usage:
  tnt2 version [flags]

### Flags:

      -h, --help   help for version

# Secret Key

The secret key that is used to encrypt/decrypt the data can be supplied 
in one (1) of three (3) ways, in order of security:

1. The program will prompt for the secret key (most secure)
2. The secret key is passed in via the tnt2Secret environment variable.
3. The secret key is passwd as arguments after all the valid options (least secure)
