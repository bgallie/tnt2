# NAME
tnt2 - an infinite key encryption system

# SYNOPSIS
**tnt2** [*OPTION*]

# DESCRIPTION
**tnt2** is an encryption/description system that uses an infinite (with
respect to the plaintext) key to encode the data.  The psuedo-random generator
used by **tnt2** can encode approximately 1.64×10³⁵ bytes before the generated
key will repeat itself.

# OPTIONS
**-a**
encrypted data is outputed using ascii85 encoding

**-c**
the plaintext is compressed before encrypting

**-d**
decrypt the input file

**-e**
encrypt the input file

**-if string**
the input file name

**-n string**
the starting block count (default: "0")

        The count can be given as a fraction of the maximum number of blocks that can 
        be generated by the encryption engine.  Using "SecretKey" as the key, there are
        52,502,767,857,008,413,094,574,854,092,948,200,044 (5.250276786×10³⁷) 32 byte 
        blocks that can be generated, resulting in a starting block count of
        26,251,383,928,504,206,547,287,427,046,474,100,022 (2.625138393×10³⁷).

**-of string**
the output file name (default: input file name with a '.tnt2' extension)

**-p**
encrypted data is outputted using PEM encoding

**-pf string**
the file name containing the proforma machine to use instead of the builtin
proforma machine

## Secret Key

The secret key that is used to encrypt/decrypt the data can be supplied 
in one (1) of three (3) ways, in order of security:

1. The program will prompt for the secret key (most secure)
2. The secret key is passed in via the tnt2Secret environment variable.
3. The secret key is passwd as arguments after all the valid options (least secure)
